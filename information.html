            <h1>Information About Badminton</h1>

            <article>
                <h2>What is badminton?</h2>
                <p>
                    Badminton is a sport in which light rackets are used to
                    volley an object—called a shuttlecock, shuttle, birdie, or
                    bird—back and forth over a high net. Unlike other similar
                    sports, such as tennis, badminton is not played with a
                    ball—the shuttlecock is a kind of feathered cone with a cork
                    head.
                </p>

            <article>
                <h2>How is badminton played?</h2>
                <p>
                    Players score points by striking a shuttlecock with their
                    racket so that it passes over the net and lands in their
                    opponents' half of the court. A rally ends once the
                    shuttlecock has struck the ground, and the shuttlecock may
                    only be struck once by each side before it passes over the
                    net.
                </p>

            <article>
                <h2>What is a match like?</h2>
                <p>
                    A badminton match can be played by two opposing players
                    (singles) or four opposing players (doubles). You can have
                    either two or four players on a badminton court: one player
                    on each side, or a team of two players on each side.
                    One-against-one is called singles; two-against-two is called
                    doubles. In doubles, either player can hit the shuttle; you
                    do not have to take it in turns.
